## TLS ##

# PEM-encoded X509 certificate for TLS.
# This certificate, as of Synapse 1.0, will need to be a valid and verifiable
# certificate, signed by a recognised Certificate Authority.
#
# Be sure to use a `.pem` file that includes the full certificate chain including
# any intermediate certificates (for instance, if using certbot, use
# `fullchain.pem` as your certificate, not `cert.pem`).

# Whether to verify TLS server certificates for outbound federation requests.

# Defaults to `true`. To disable certificate verification, uncomment the
# following line.

#federation_verify_certificates: false

# The minimum TLS version that will be used for outbound federation requests.
#
# Defaults to `1`. Configurable to `1`, `1.1`, `1.2`, or `1.3`. Note
# that setting this value higher than `1.2` will prevent federation to most
# of the public Matrix network: only configure it to `1.3` if you have an
# entirely private federation setup and you can ensure TLS 1.3 support.

# Skip federation certificate verification on the following whitelist
# of domains.
#
# This setting should only be used in very specific cases, such as
# federation over Tor hidden services and similar. For private networks
# of homeservers, you likely want to use a private CA instead.
#
# Only effective if federation_verify_certicates is `true`.

# List of custom certificate authorities for federation traffic.

# This setting should only normally be used within a private network of
# homeservers.
#
# Note that this list will replace those that are provided by your
