## Server ##

# The public-facing domain of the server
#
# The server_name name will appear at the end of usernames and room addresses
# created on this server. For example if the server_name was example.com,
# usernames on this server would be in the format @user:example.com
#
# In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
# matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the server_name for the same
# reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email address.
# See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html
# for information on how to host Synapse on a subdomain while preserving
# a clean server_name.
#
# The server_name cannot be changed later so it is important to
# configure this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all
# lowercase and may contain an explicit port.
# Examples: matrix.org, localhost:8080
#
server_name: {{ synapse_tld }}

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
#
pid_file: DATADIR/homeserver.pid

# The absolute URL to the web client which / will redirect to.
#
#web_client_location: https://riot.example.com/

# The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this Homeserver (not
# including _matrix/...). This is the same URL a user might enter into the
# 'Custom Homeserver URL' field on their client. If you use Synapse with a
# reverse proxy, this should be the URL to reach Synapse via the proxy.
# Otherwise, it should be the URL to reach Synapse's client HTTP listener (see
# 'listeners' below).
#
# Defaults to 'https://<server_name>/'.
#
#public_baseurl: https://example.com/

# Uncomment the following to tell other servers to send federation traffic on
# port 443.
#
# By default, other servers will try to reach our server on port 8448, which can
# be inconvenient in some environments.
#
# Provided 'https://<server_name>/' on port 443 is routed to Synapse, this
# option configures Synapse to serve a file at
# 'https://<server_name>/.well-known/matrix/server'. This will tell other
# servers to send traffic to port 443 instead.
#
# See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html for more
# information.
#
# Defaults to 'false'.
#
#serve_server_wellknown: true

# Set the soft limit on the number of file descriptors synapse can use
# Zero is used to indicate synapse should set the soft limit to the
# hard limit.
#
#soft_file_limit: 0

# Presence tracking allows users to see the state (e.g online/offline)
# of other local and remote users.
#
presence:
  # Uncomment to disable presence tracking on this homeserver. This option
  # replaces the previous top-level 'use_presence' option.
  #
  #enabled: false

# Whether to require authentication to retrieve profile data (avatars,
# display names) of other users through the client API. Defaults to
# 'false'. Note that profile data is also available via the federation
# API, unless allow_profile_lookup_over_federation is set to false.
#
#require_auth_for_profile_requests: true

# Uncomment to require a user to share a room with another user in order
# to retrieve their profile information. Only checked on Client-Server
# requests. Profile requests from other servers should be checked by the
# requesting server. Defaults to 'false'.
#
#limit_profile_requests_to_users_who_share_rooms: true

# Uncomment to prevent a user's profile data from being retrieved and
# displayed in a room until they have joined it. By default, a user's
# profile data is included in an invite event, regardless of the values
# of the above two settings, and whether or not the users share a server.
# Defaults to 'true'.
#
#include_profile_data_on_invite: false

# If set to 'true', removes the need for authentication to access the server's
# public rooms directory through the client API, meaning that anyone can
# query the room directory. Defaults to 'false'.
#
#allow_public_rooms_without_auth: true

# If set to 'true', allows any other homeserver to fetch the server's public
# rooms directory via federation. Defaults to 'false'.
#
#allow_public_rooms_over_federation: true

# The default room version for newly created rooms.
#
# Known room versions are listed here:
# https://spec.matrix.org/latest/rooms/#complete-list-of-room-versions
#
# For example, for room version 1, default_room_version should be set
# to "1".
#
#default_room_version: "6"

# The GC threshold parameters to pass to `gc.set_threshold`, if defined
#
#gc_thresholds: [700, 10, 10]

# The minimum time in seconds between each GC for a generation, regardless of
# the GC thresholds. This ensures that we don't do GC too frequently.
#
# A value of `[1s, 10s, 30s]` indicates that a second must pass between consecutive
# generation 0 GCs, etc.
#
# Defaults to `[1s, 10s, 30s]`.
#
#gc_min_interval: [0.5s, 30s, 1m]

# Set the limit on the returned events in the timeline in the get
# and sync operations. The default value is 100. -1 means no upper limit.
#
# Uncomment the following to increase the limit to 5000.
#
#filter_timeline_limit: 5000

# Whether room invites to users on this server should be blocked
# (except those sent by local server admins). The default is False.
#
#block_non_admin_invites: true

# Room searching
#
# If disabled, new messages will not be indexed for searching and users
# will receive errors when searching for messages. Defaults to enabled.
#
#enable_search: false

# Prevent outgoing requests from being sent to the following blacklisted IP address
# CIDR ranges. If this option is not specified then it defaults to private IP
# address ranges (see the example below).
#
# The blacklist applies to the outbound requests for federation, identity servers,
# push servers, and for checking key validity for third-party invite events.
#
# (0.0.0.0 and :: are always blacklisted, whether or not they are explicitly
# listed here, since they correspond to unroutable addresses.)
#
# This option replaces federation_ip_range_blacklist in Synapse v1.25.0.
#
# Note: The value is ignored when an HTTP proxy is in use
#
#ip_range_blacklist:
#  - '127.0.0.0/8'
#  - '10.0.0.0/8'
#  - '172.16.0.0/12'
#  - '192.168.0.0/16'

#  - 'fec0::/10'

# List of IP address CIDR ranges that should be allowed for federation,
# identity servers, push servers, and for checking key validity for
# third-party invite events. This is useful for specifying exceptions to
# wide-ranging blacklisted target IP ranges - e.g. for communication with
# a push server only visible in your network.
#
# This whitelist overrides ip_range_blacklist and defaults to an empty
# list.
#
#ip_range_whitelist:
#   - '192.168.1.1'

# List of ports that Synapse should listen on, their purpose and their
# configuration.
#
# Options for each listener include:
#
#   port: the TCP port to bind to
#
#   bind_addresses: a list of local addresses to listen on. The default is
#       'all local interfaces'.
#
#   type: the type of listener. Normally 'http', but other valid options are:
#       'manhole' (see https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/manhole.html),
#       'metrics' (see https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/metrics-howto.html),
#       'replication' (see https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html).
#
#   tls: set to true to enable TLS for this listener. Will use the TLS
#       key/cert specified in tls_private_key_path / tls_certificate_path.
#
#   x_forwarded: Only valid for an 'http' listener. Set to true to use the
#       X-Forwarded-For header as the client IP. Useful when Synapse is
#       behind a reverse-proxy.
#
#   resources: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A list of resources to host
#       on this port. Options for each resource are:
#
#       names: a list of names of HTTP resources. See below for a list of
#           valid resource names.
#
#       compress: set to true to enable HTTP compression for this resource.
#
#   additional_resources: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A map of
#        additional endpoints which should be loaded via dynamic modules.
#
# Valid resource names are:
#
#   client: the client-server API (/_matrix/client), and the synapse admin
#       API (/_synapse/admin). Also implies 'media' and 'static'.
#
#   consent: user consent forms (/_matrix/consent).
#       See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/consent_tracking.html.
#
#   federation: the server-server API (/_matrix/federation). Also implies
#       'media', 'keys', 'openid'
#
#   keys: the key discovery API (/_matrix/keys).
#
#   media: the media API (/_matrix/media).
#
#   metrics: the metrics interface.
#       See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/metrics-howto.html.
#
#   openid: OpenID authentication.
#
#   replication: the HTTP replication API (/_synapse/replication).
#       See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html.
#
#   static: static resources under synapse/static (/_matrix/static). (Mostly
#       useful for 'fallback authentication'.)
#

manhole_settings:
  # The username for the manhole. This defaults to 'matrix'.
  #
  #username: manhole

  # The password for the manhole. This defaults to 'rabbithole'.
  #
  #password: mypassword

  # The private and public SSH key pair used to encrypt the manhole traffic.
  # If these are left unset, then hardcoded and non-secret keys are used,
  # which could allow traffic to be intercepted if sent over a public network.
  #
  #ssh_priv_key_path: CONFDIR/id_rsa
  #ssh_pub_key_path: CONFDIR/id_rsa.pub

# Forward extremities can build up in a room due to networking delays between
# homeservers. Once this happens in a large room, calculation of the state of
# that room can become quite expensive. To mitigate this, once the number of
# forward extremities reaches a given threshold, Synapse will send an
# org.matrix.dummy_event event, which will reduce the forward extremities
# in the room.
#
# This setting defines the threshold (i.e. number of forward extremities in the
# room) at which dummy events are sent. The default value is 10.
#
#dummy_events_threshold: 5
